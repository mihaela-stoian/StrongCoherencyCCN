# Extending CCN+ to be strongly coherent with requirements
This repository contains the source code for the CCN+ framework along with some examples and tests.

This code is based on https://github.com/atatomir/CCN
Â© Alex Tatomir, University of Oxford, Submitted as part or MCompSci in Computer Science, Part C.

The code here extends the above repository to support strong coherency with requirements which we used in our [paper]((https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X24000112?dgcid=rss_sd_all)) titled "CCN+: A neuro-symbolic framework for deep learning with requirements".

If you use this paper or the code found here or in the [repository mentioned above](https://github.com/atatomir/CCN), please cite the following:

**Differently from the code in the previous repository, this branch uses [PiShield](https://github.com/mihaela-stoian/PiShield) for integrating the constraint layer into the neural network models.**
